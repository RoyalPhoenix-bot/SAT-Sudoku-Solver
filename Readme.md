# About
Shadow Sudoku: Two pairs of sudoku with an additional condition imposed that the corresponding cells of both the sudoku's can't be the same number.
#### Assigment 1
+ Made a `nxn` sudoku pair solver(solving 2 shadow sudoku's) using SAT(Boolean Satisfiability Problem).
+ An `nxn` Maximal-Sudoku Pair Generator, which generates a pair of maximal shadow sudokus. Maximal Sudoku means that if any number is additional removed from the sudoku, there won't exist a unique solution(i.e., the pair will have multiple solutions).
#### Assignment 2
+ Created our own SAT solver using two methods, DPLL and Semantic Tableau. Implemented both the approaches in `C++`.
